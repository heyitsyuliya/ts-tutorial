// typescript is smart enough to know that popularTags is an array of strings
// however, for code claity it is best to define the type for that specific entity
var popularTags = ['pro', 'sponsor'];
// this line is erroring out as the type of this entity can only be either string or null
//const sponsorsTag: MaybePopularTag = []
